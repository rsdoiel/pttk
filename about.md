title: pttk
abstract: "pttk is a plain text tool kit for writing. The main focus is on static web using Markdown documents.  The metaphor behind the tool kit is a deconstructed content management system. It is easily scripted from your favorite POSIX shell or Makefile. It provides a number of functions including a sitemapper, rss generator, blogging tool call blogit, a tool that can form series based on Markdown front matter. To preview your site a &quot;ws&quot; action is included that functions as a localhost web server. Between tools like pttk, PageFind and Flatlake you can provide much of the dynamic capability you&#x27;d find in a traditional CMS like Wordpress without running one."
